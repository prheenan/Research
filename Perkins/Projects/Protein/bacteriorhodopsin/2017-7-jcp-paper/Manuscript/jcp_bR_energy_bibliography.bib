	abstract = {Dynamic force spectroscopy probes the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of single molecules and molecular assemblies. Here, we propose a simple procedure to extract kinetic information from such experiments. The cornerstone of our method is a transformation of the rupture-force histograms obtained at different force-loading rates into the force-dependent lifetimes measurable in constant-force experiments. To interpret the force-dependent lifetimes, we derive a generalization of Bell's formula that is formally exact within the framework of Kramers theory. This result complements the analytical expression for the lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model potentials. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing the nanopore unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached by flexible linkers to an atomic force microscope. Our procedure to transform rupture-force histograms into the force-dependent lifetimes remains valid even when the molecular extension is a poor reaction coordinate and higher-dimensional free-energy surfaces must be considered. In this case the microscopic interpretation of the lifetimes becomes more challenging because the lifetimes can reveal richer, and even nonmonotonic, dependence on the force.},

	abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used in the biological sciences. Despite 25 years of technical developments, two popular modes of bioAFM, imaging and single molecule force spectroscopy, remain hindered by relatively poor force precision and stability. Recently, we achieved both sub-pN force precision and stability under biologically useful conditions (in liquid at room temperature). Importantly, this sub-pN level of performance is routinely accessible using a commercial cantilever on a commercial instrument. The two critical results are that (i) force precision and stability were limited by the gold coating on the cantilevers, and (ii) smaller yet stiffer cantilevers did not lead to better force precision on time scales longer than 25 ms. These new findings complement our previous work that addressed tip-sample stability. In this review, we detail the methods needed to achieve this sub-pN force stability and demonstrate improvements in force spectroscopy and imaging when using uncoated cantilevers. With this improved cantilever performance, the widespread use of nonspecific biomolecular attachments becomes a limiting factor in high-precision studies. Thus, we conclude by briefly reviewing site-specific covalent-immobilization protocols for linking a biomolecule to the substrate and to the AFM tip.},

Such SMFS studies and, more generally, the diverse applications of AFM across biophysics and nanotechnology are improved by enhancing data quality via improved force stability, force precision, and temporal resolution. For an advanced, small-format commercial AFM, we illustrate how these three metrics are limited by the cantilever itself rather than the larger microscope structure, and then describe three increasingly sophisticated cantilever modifications that yield enhanced data quality. First, sub-pN force precision and stability over a broad bandwidth (Δf = 0.01–20 Hz) is routinely achieved by removing a long (L = 100 μm) cantilever’s gold coating. Next, this sub-pN bandwidth is extended by a factor of ∼50 to span five decades of bandwidth (Δf = 0.01–1000 Hz) by using a focused ion beam (FIB) to modify a shorter (L = 40 μm) cantilever. Finally, FIB-modifying an ultrashort (L = 9 μm) cantilever improves its force stability and precision while maintaining 1-μs temporal resolution. These modified ultrashort cantilevers have a reduced quality factor (Q ≈ 0.5) and therefore do not apply a substantial (30–90 pN), high-frequency force modulation to the molecule, a phenomenon that is unaccounted for in traditional SMFS analysis. Currently, there is no perfect cantilever for all applications. Optimizing AFM-based SMFS requires understanding the tradeoffs inherent to using a specific cantilever and choosing the one best suited to a particular application.},

Elucidating the details of how complex proteins fold is a longstanding challenge. Key insights into the unfolding pathways of diverse proteins have come from single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments in which proteins are literally pulled apart. Yu et al. developed a SMFS technique that could unfold individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules in a native lipid bilayer with 1-µs temporal resolution (see the Perspective by Müller and Gaub). The technique delivered a 100-fold improvement over earlier studies of bacteriorhodopsin and revealed many intermediates not seen before. The authors also observed unfolding and refolding transitions between intermediate states.
Science, this issue p. 945; see also p. 907
Protein folding occurs as a set of transitions between structural states within an energy landscape. An oversimplified view of the folding process emerges when transiently populated states are undetected because of limited instrumental resolution. Using force spectroscopy optimized for 1-microsecond resolution, we reexamined the unfolding of individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules in native lipid bilayers. The experimental data reveal the unfolding pathway in unprecedented detail. Numerous newly detected intermediates—many separated by as few as two or three amino acids—exhibited complex dynamics, including frequent refolding and state occupancies of {\textless}10 μs. Equilibrium measurements between such states enabled the folding free-energy landscape to be deduced. These results sharpen the picture of the mechanical unfolding of membrane proteins and, more broadly, enable experimental access to previously obscured protein dynamics.

	abstract = {A conversion between macromolecular shapes—a conformational change—is usually the mechanism that gives function to biological macromolecules. Single-molecule force spectroscopy probes conformational changes by applying force to individual macromolecules and recording their response, or “mechanical fingerprints”, in the form of force–extension curves. The mechanical fingerprints of proteins, nucleic acids, and their assemblies often feature elaborate signatures that reflect the complexity of the underlying biomolecular interactions. This study introduces a transformation that converts—in a model-free way—the mechanical fingerprints of a complex system into a map of force-dependent transition rates. Once transformed into a rate map, the mechanical fingerprints can be interpreted in terms of the activation barriers and the intrinsic timescales of a biological process., Biological processes are carried out through molecular conformational transitions, ranging from the structural changes within biomolecules to the formation of macromolecular complexes and the associations between the complexes themselves. These transitions cover a vast range of timescales and are governed by a tangled network of molecular interactions. The resulting hierarchy of interactions, in turn, becomes encoded in the experimentally measurable “mechanical fingerprints” of the biomolecules, their force–extension curves. However, how can we decode these fingerprints so that they reveal the kinetic barriers and the associated timescales of a biological process? Here, we show that this can be accomplished with a simple, model-free transformation that is general enough to be applicable to molecular interactions involving an arbitrarily large number of kinetic barriers. Specifically, the transformation converts the mechanical fingerprints of the system directly into a map of force-dependent rate constants. This map reveals the kinetics of the multitude of rate processes in the system beyond what is typically accessible to direct measurements. With the contributions from individual barriers to the interaction network now “untangled”, the map is straightforward to analyze in terms of the prominent barriers and timescales. Practical implementation of the transformation is illustrated with simulated biomolecular interactions that comprise different patterns of complexity—from a cascade of activation barriers to competing dissociation pathways.},

The sequential steps of molecular interactions driving these processes con be described by dynamic energy landscapes. The conceptual energy landscape allows to follow the complex reaction pathways of membrane proteins while its modifications describe why and how pathways ore changed. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) detects, quantifies and locates interactions within and between membrane proteins. SMFS helps to determine how these interactions change with temperature, point mutations, oligomerization and the functional states of membrane proteins. Applied in different modes, SMFS explores the co-existence and population of reaction pathways in the energy landscape of the protein and thus reveals detailed insights into local mechanisms, determining its structural and functional relationships.

	abstract = {Mechanical single-molecule techniques offer exciting possibilities to investigate protein folding and stability in native environments at submolecular resolution. By applying a free-energy reconstruction procedure developed by Hummer and Szabo, which is based on a statistical theorem introduced by Jarzynski, we determined the unfolding free energy of the membrane proteins bacteriorhodopsin (BR), halorhodopsin, and the sodium-proton antiporter NhaA. The calculated energies ranged from 290.5 kcal/mol for BR to 485.5 kcal/mol for NhaA. For the remarkably stable BR, the equilibrium unfolding free energy was independent of pulling rate and temperature ranging between 18 and 42°C. Our experiments also revealed heterogeneous energetic properties in individual transmembrane helices. In halorhodopsin, the stabilization of a short helical segment yielded a characteristic signature in the energy profile. In NhaA, a pronounced peak was observed at a functionally important site in the protein. Since a large variety of single- and multispan membrane proteins can be tackled in mechanical unfolding experiments, our approach provides a basis for systematically elucidating energetic properties of membrane proteins with the resolution of individual secondary-structure elements.

The inclusion of ZnCl2 in SMFS assay buffer increased the stability of most structural segments. This effect was not mimicked by CaCl2, CdCl2, or CoCl2. Thus, Zn2+ stabilizes the structure of rhodopsin in a specific manner.},

	abstract = {The energy landscape theory of protein folding is a statistical description of a protein's potential surface. It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed. The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure prediction.},

Measurements of recombinant titin immunoglobulin segments of two different lengths exhibited the same pattern and allowed attribution of the discontinuities to the unfolding of individual immunoglobulin domains. The forces required to unfold individual domains ranged from 150 to 300 piconewtons and depended on the pulling speed. Upon relaxation, refolding of immunoglobulin domains was observed.},

	abstract = {Titin, a giant filamentous polypeptide, is believed to play a fundamental role in maintaining sarcomeric structural integrity and developing what is known as passive force in muscle. Measurements of the force required to stretch a single molecule revealed that titin behaves as a highly nonlinear entropic spring. The molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20 to 30 piconewtons and refolds in a low-force transition at approximately 2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the molecule (5 to 40 percent) remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain's bending rigidity) of 20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative to the stretch and release rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to sarcomeric dimensions reproduced many features of the passive force versus extension curve of muscle fibers.},

Advances in single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopy techniques allow investigation of the folding and dynamics of single protein molecules, both at equilibrium and as they fold and unfold. The experiments are far from simple, however, both in execution and in interpretation of the results. In this review, we discuss some of the highlights of the work so far and concentrate on cases where comparisons with the classical experiments can be made. We conclude that, although there have been relatively few startling insights from single-molecule studies, the rapid progress that has been made suggests that these experiments have significant potential to advance our understanding of protein folding. In particular, new techniques offer the possibility to explore regions of the energy landscape that are inaccessible to classical ensemble measurements and, perhaps, to observe rare events undetectable by other means.},

Examples of such functions are signaling, ion pumping, energy conversion, molecular transport, specific ligand binding, cell adhesion and protein trafficking. However, it is not well understood how most membrane proteins work and how the living cell regulates their function. We review how atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be applied for structural and functional investigations of native membrane proteins. High-resolution time-lapse AFM imaging records membrane proteins at work, their oligomeric state and their dynamic assembly. The AFM stylus resembles a multifunctional toolbox that allows the measurement of several chemical and physical parameters at the nanoscale. In the single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) mode, AFM quantifies and localizes interactions in membrane proteins that stabilize their folding and modulate their functional state. Dynamic SMFS discloses fascinating insights into the free energy landscape of membrane proteins. Single-cell force spectroscopy quantifies the interactions of live cells with their environment to single-receptor resolution. In the future, technological progress in AFM-based approaches will enable us to study the physical nature of biological interactions in more detail and decipher how cells control basic processes.},

Presented is an extension to the existing force spectroscopy experiments. While unfolding single bacteriorhodopsins from native purple membranes, small oscillation amplitudes (6–9 nm) were supplied to the vertical displacement of the cantilever at a frequency of 3 kHz. The phase and amplitude response of the cantilever-protein system was converted to reveal the elastic (conservative) and viscous (dissipative) contributions to the unfolding process. The elastic response (stiffness) of the extended parts of the protein were in the range of a few tens pN/nm and could be well described by the derivative of the wormlike chain model. Discrete events in the viscous response coincided with the unfolding of single secondary structure elements and were in the range of 1 μNs/m. In addition, these force modulation spectroscopy experiments revealed novel mechanical unfolding intermediates of bacteriorhodopsin. We found that kinks result in a loss of unfolding cooperativity in transmembrane helices. Reconstructing force-distance spectra by the integration of amplitude-distance spectra verified their position, offering a novel approach to detect intermediates during the forced unfolding of single proteins.},
