	abstract = {Dynamic force spectroscopy probes the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of single molecules and molecular assemblies. Here, we propose a simple procedure to extract kinetic information from such experiments. The cornerstone of our method is a transformation of the rupture-force histograms obtained at different force-loading rates into the force-dependent lifetimes measurable in constant-force experiments. To interpret the force-dependent lifetimes, we derive a generalization of Bell's formula that is formally exact within the framework of Kramers theory. This result complements the analytical expression for the lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model potentials. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing the nanopore unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached by flexible linkers to an atomic force microscope. Our procedure to transform rupture-force histograms into the force-dependent lifetimes remains valid even when the molecular extension is a poor reaction coordinate and higher-dimensional free-energy surfaces must be considered. In this case the microscopic interpretation of the lifetimes becomes more challenging because the lifetimes can reveal richer, and even nonmonotonic, dependence on the force.},

	abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used in the biological sciences. Despite 25 years of technical developments, two popular modes of bioAFM, imaging and single molecule force spectroscopy, remain hindered by relatively poor force precision and stability. Recently, we achieved both sub-pN force precision and stability under biologically useful conditions (in liquid at room temperature). Importantly, this sub-pN level of performance is routinely accessible using a commercial cantilever on a commercial instrument. The two critical results are that (i) force precision and stability were limited by the gold coating on the cantilevers, and (ii) smaller yet stiffer cantilevers did not lead to better force precision on time scales longer than 25 ms. These new findings complement our previous work that addressed tip-sample stability. In this review, we detail the methods needed to achieve this sub-pN force stability and demonstrate improvements in force spectroscopy and imaging when using uncoated cantilevers. With this improved cantilever performance, the widespread use of nonspecific biomolecular attachments becomes a limiting factor in high-precision studies. Thus, we conclude by briefly reviewing site-specific covalent-immobilization protocols for linking a biomolecule to the substrate and to the AFM tip.},

Such SMFS studies and, more generally, the diverse applications of AFM across biophysics and nanotechnology are improved by enhancing data quality via improved force stability, force precision, and temporal resolution. For an advanced, small-format commercial AFM, we illustrate how these three metrics are limited by the cantilever itself rather than the larger microscope structure, and then describe three increasingly sophisticated cantilever modifications that yield enhanced data quality. First, sub-pN force precision and stability over a broad bandwidth (Δf = 0.01–20 Hz) is routinely achieved by removing a long (L = 100 μm) cantilever’s gold coating. Next, this sub-pN bandwidth is extended by a factor of ∼50 to span five decades of bandwidth (Δf = 0.01–1000 Hz) by using a focused ion beam (FIB) to modify a shorter (L = 40 μm) cantilever. Finally, FIB-modifying an ultrashort (L = 9 μm) cantilever improves its force stability and precision while maintaining 1-μs temporal resolution. These modified ultrashort cantilevers have a reduced quality factor (Q ≈ 0.5) and therefore do not apply a substantial (30–90 pN), high-frequency force modulation to the molecule, a phenomenon that is unaccounted for in traditional SMFS analysis. Currently, there is no perfect cantilever for all applications. Optimizing AFM-based SMFS requires understanding the tradeoffs inherent to using a specific cantilever and choosing the one best suited to a particular application.},

Elucidating the details of how complex proteins fold is a longstanding challenge. Key insights into the unfolding pathways of diverse proteins have come from single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments in which proteins are literally pulled apart. Yu et al. developed a SMFS technique that could unfold individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules in a native lipid bilayer with 1-µs temporal resolution (see the Perspective by Müller and Gaub). The technique delivered a 100-fold improvement over earlier studies of bacteriorhodopsin and revealed many intermediates not seen before. The authors also observed unfolding and refolding transitions between intermediate states.
Science, this issue p. 945; see also p. 907
Protein folding occurs as a set of transitions between structural states within an energy landscape. An oversimplified view of the folding process emerges when transiently populated states are undetected because of limited instrumental resolution. Using force spectroscopy optimized for 1-microsecond resolution, we reexamined the unfolding of individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules in native lipid bilayers. The experimental data reveal the unfolding pathway in unprecedented detail. Numerous newly detected intermediates—many separated by as few as two or three amino acids—exhibited complex dynamics, including frequent refolding and state occupancies of {\textless}10 μs. Equilibrium measurements between such states enabled the folding free-energy landscape to be deduced. These results sharpen the picture of the mechanical unfolding of membrane proteins and, more broadly, enable experimental access to previously obscured protein dynamics.

	abstract = {A conversion between macromolecular shapes—a conformational change—is usually the mechanism that gives function to biological macromolecules. Single-molecule force spectroscopy probes conformational changes by applying force to individual macromolecules and recording their response, or “mechanical fingerprints”, in the form of force–extension curves. The mechanical fingerprints of proteins, nucleic acids, and their assemblies often feature elaborate signatures that reflect the complexity of the underlying biomolecular interactions. This study introduces a transformation that converts—in a model-free way—the mechanical fingerprints of a complex system into a map of force-dependent transition rates. Once transformed into a rate map, the mechanical fingerprints can be interpreted in terms of the activation barriers and the intrinsic timescales of a biological process., Biological processes are carried out through molecular conformational transitions, ranging from the structural changes within biomolecules to the formation of macromolecular complexes and the associations between the complexes themselves. These transitions cover a vast range of timescales and are governed by a tangled network of molecular interactions. The resulting hierarchy of interactions, in turn, becomes encoded in the experimentally measurable “mechanical fingerprints” of the biomolecules, their force–extension curves. However, how can we decode these fingerprints so that they reveal the kinetic barriers and the associated timescales of a biological process? Here, we show that this can be accomplished with a simple, model-free transformation that is general enough to be applicable to molecular interactions involving an arbitrarily large number of kinetic barriers. Specifically, the transformation converts the mechanical fingerprints of the system directly into a map of force-dependent rate constants. This map reveals the kinetics of the multitude of rate processes in the system beyond what is typically accessible to direct measurements. With the contributions from individual barriers to the interaction network now “untangled”, the map is straightforward to analyze in terms of the prominent barriers and timescales. Practical implementation of the transformation is illustrated with simulated biomolecular interactions that comprise different patterns of complexity—from a cascade of activation barriers to competing dissociation pathways.},

The sequential steps of molecular interactions driving these processes con be described by dynamic energy landscapes. The conceptual energy landscape allows to follow the complex reaction pathways of membrane proteins while its modifications describe why and how pathways ore changed. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) detects, quantifies and locates interactions within and between membrane proteins. SMFS helps to determine how these interactions change with temperature, point mutations, oligomerization and the functional states of membrane proteins. Applied in different modes, SMFS explores the co-existence and population of reaction pathways in the energy landscape of the protein and thus reveals detailed insights into local mechanisms, determining its structural and functional relationships.

	abstract = {Mechanical single-molecule techniques offer exciting possibilities to investigate protein folding and stability in native environments at submolecular resolution. By applying a free-energy reconstruction procedure developed by Hummer and Szabo, which is based on a statistical theorem introduced by Jarzynski, we determined the unfolding free energy of the membrane proteins bacteriorhodopsin (BR), halorhodopsin, and the sodium-proton antiporter NhaA. The calculated energies ranged from 290.5 kcal/mol for BR to 485.5 kcal/mol for NhaA. For the remarkably stable BR, the equilibrium unfolding free energy was independent of pulling rate and temperature ranging between 18 and 42°C. Our experiments also revealed heterogeneous energetic properties in individual transmembrane helices. In halorhodopsin, the stabilization of a short helical segment yielded a characteristic signature in the energy profile. In NhaA, a pronounced peak was observed at a functionally important site in the protein. Since a large variety of single- and multispan membrane proteins can be tackled in mechanical unfolding experiments, our approach provides a basis for systematically elucidating energetic properties of membrane proteins with the resolution of individual secondary-structure elements.

	abstract = {Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is a powerful tool to dissect molecular interactions that govern the stability and function of proteins. We applied SMFS to understand the effect of Zn2+ on the molecular interactions underlying the structure of rhodopsin. Force-distance curves obtained from SMFS assays revealed the strength and location of molecular interactions that stabilize structural segments within this receptor. The inclusion of ZnCl2 in SMFS assay buffer increased the stability of most structural segments. This effect was not mimicked by CaCl2, CdCl2, or CoCl2. Thus, Zn2+ stabilizes the structure of rhodopsin in a specific manner.},
