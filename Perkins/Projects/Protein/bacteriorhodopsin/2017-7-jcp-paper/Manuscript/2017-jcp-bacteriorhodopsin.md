{#label_fig:diagram} Atomic force microscopy measures the unfolding and refolding of bacteriorhodopsin under mechanical load. **(A)** A cartoon of the pulling geometry used to unfold the membrane-bound protein bacteriorhodopsin. **(B)** A representative force versus time molecular extension curve. The first 20nm of all curves are not analyzed due to non-specific surface adhesion. The colored bars correspond to the regions where the helical pairs from (A) rupture. **(C,D)** A detailed plot the regions in the A and E helices where the helices exhibit transitions between states under load.

{#label_fig:full} Energy landscape reconstruction of bacteriorhodopsin reveals significant intra-molecule variation in unfolding energy.  **(A)** A heat map of all force-extension curves used in this work. Data within 20nm of the surface are excluded due to surface adhesion. **(B)** The mean free energy at zero force (black dotted line) and free energy change per amino acid (purple line) reconstructed using an Inverse Weierstrass Transform applied to the data in (A).  The shaded region gives the standard deviation from three non-overlapping subsets of the data in (A).

{#label_fig:helixE} The ED helical pair has a significantly higher average unfolding energy than the CB helical pair or the A Helix. This figure is formatted as {#ref_fig:full}, but applied to the region of the force-extension curve of the ED Helical pair.
