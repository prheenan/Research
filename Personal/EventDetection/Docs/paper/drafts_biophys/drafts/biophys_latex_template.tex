The folding and unfolding of proteins over milliseconds is commonly described using conventional chemical kinetics and transition-state theory (1). On submicrosecond timescales, it has been reported that proteins are simply too large to undergo the significant structural changes required for folding, and that the assumptions of conventional rate kinetics break down (1). ``Speed limits'' for protein folding of the order of 1 $\mu{\rm s}$ have been reported (2,3). In general, smaller and less complex proteins fold and unfold more quickly than larger proteins, and most cases of folding near the ``speed limit" involve polypeptides ${<}100$ residues in size.

By measuring protein activity we monitor the active site of proteins without making assumptions about how much secondary structure remains intact away from the active site. In this article, we define unfolding to refer to a structural change significant enough to cause loss of protein activity.

\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] Heat rapidly diffuses away from very thin layers in a heat conductive medium. By solving the heat conduction equation, it is readily shown that confining a temperature rise to a small structure results in extremely fast cooling times.

\item[b.] Metals combine a high thermal conductivity with a large extinction coefficient for visible light. For example, a 150 nm gold film on glass transmits $<0.1\%$ of incident laser light (Fig. 1 {\it a}). The film is also thin enough to deliver significant heat to the gold surface and the liquid medium in contact with it. In this way, ``pure'' conducted heat is delivered to macromolecules attached to the gold-liquid interface without the complicating effect of large electromagnetic fields, or photons with sufficient energy to break covalent bonds.

\item[c.] The boiling of a liquid on a surface requires the formation of active vapor nuclei. For a smooth water-metal interface at the temperatures and timescales we employ, the rate of vapor generation is negligible (11).
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


Our apparatus (Fig. 1 {\it a}) consists of a frequency doubled (532 nm) Nd:YAG laser with 5 ns pulse length, heating a 135 nm thick gold film with 15 nm chromium underlayer on a glass substrate. The chromium is used to increase film adhesion and also increases the absorbance of laser light.

% Here references are directly included this tex file.
% But we can generate reference list from bibliography database
% Compile and format the bibliography (bj_bibtex_template.bib BibTeX
% file must be present in the document directory)

%The source file for this document is called
%\emph{biophys\_latex\_template.tex}.  Apart from this \LaTeX\ file, you
%will also need the bibliography file, the \BibTeX\ style file, and the
%EPS and PDF figure files.

%See the bibliography file \emph{bj\_bibtex\_template.bib} for the
%literature data.  It was mostly generated from the saved
%text-formatted PubMed entries using the \emph{med2bib} program and
%edited by the \emph{tkbibtex} or directly in the \emph{emacs} editor.

%The \emph{biophysj.bst} file is a \BibTeX\ style file that contains
%information about the format required by Biophysical Journal for the
%list of references.

% Bibliography style (requires the style file biophysj.bst in the
% document directory)

%%Automatically it will add the figure legends  and table legends as a list by below command

% Figures and Tables coding should be placed where the

% All the Figure files should be placed same working directory,

% in the document directory)
