## {#sec:Surface} Azide-functionalized surfaces

Glass surfaces were etched using potassium hydroxide. 12 mm diameter glass disks Ted Pella 26023 were sonicated Branson 2510 for 5 minutes in 250 mL of ACS grade acetone Fisher A18-4, 5 minutes in 250 mL of 95\% ethanol Decon 2801, and transferred to a solution of 80 g of potassium hydroxide Fisher P250-500 dissolved in  170 mL of 95\% ethanol and 80 mL of deionized water Barnstead GenPure Pro for 3 minutes. To removed residual KOH, the glass was serially diluted in two 1 L beakers of 18.2 M$\Omega$ deionized water. The etched surfaces were dried with 99.8\% pure nitrogen gas Airgas NI UHP-300 and stored at room temperature in a dust-proof box. 

To create azide-functionalized surfaces, etched glass was activated using 30 minutes exposure in an UV-ozone chamber Novascan PSDP Digital UV Ozone System and incubated for three hours in a 70 mL, $60^{\circ}$C solution of 0.15 mg/mL 600 Dalton Silane-PEG-Azide Nanocs PG2-AZSL-600 dissolved in toluene Sigma 179418-4L. The surfaces were then mounted in a custom-made teflon-holder and rinsed serially in 250 mL of toluene, isopropanol Fisher A416-4, and deionized water. The azide-functionalized surfaces were dried with nitrogen gas and stored in a dust-proof container at $4^{\circ}$C.

## {#sec:Sample} DNA Samples

For the 1914 basepair (bp) double-stranded DNA, the 1607 forward-sense and 3520 reverse-sense primers ({#tbl:Sequences}) for the M13mp18 plasmid New England BioLabs N4018S were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies  and used for polymerase-chain reaction Millipore 71086-4 using 40 cycles on a thermocycler Bio-Rad T100. The reverse-sense primer was modified to include three biotinylated thymidine bases and a 5-prime biotin after a PEG spacer. The forward-sense primer was modified to include a 5-prime dibenzocyclooctyl (DBCO) after a PEG-spacer (see {#tbl:Sequences}). After the PCR product was purified Qiagen 28106 and the 1.9 kbp band selected by 2\% gel electrophoresis Sigma A9539-500 as shown in {#fig:Prep}, the agarose was eluted out Bio-Rad 732-6165, the DNA solution was concentrated Millipore UFC501096 and purified Qiagen 28106. The purified construct was stored at $4^{\circ}$C in a solution of 10 mM Tris Fisher BP151-1 and 1 mM EDTA Fisher S311-500 at pH 8.0, referred to after as 'TE'. The typical recovery efficiency of DNA purification after polymerase chain reaction was 25\%. 

The purity of the DNA was verified by depositing 20 pmol of DNA in imaging buffer \textemdash{} 3 mM Nickel Sigma 654597, 10 mM Hepes Sigma H4034 at pH 7 \textemdash{} onto freshly-cleaved, 10 mm diameter, V1 mica Ted Pella 50 for 10 minutes, rinsing serially 5 times with 1 mL of deionized water and 5 times with 1 mL of imaging buffer. The sample was then imaged with the Cypher AFM using a cantilever with a nominal 2 nm radius, a spring constant of $\approx 300 \frac{\text{pN}}{\text{nm}}$ Bruker SNL-10, a line scan rate of 1 Hz, a 1 \textmu{m} scan size, and free amplitude of $\approx 1$ nm ({#fig:Prep}). 

For DNA deposition onto an azide surface, 20 \textmu{L} of the DNA at 40 nM was mixed with 80 uL of TE and deposited onto azide-functionalized glass (see {#sec:Surface}) affixed with 5 minute epoxy Devcon 14250 to specimen disks Ted Pella 16218 and incubated at $4^{\circ}$C overnight. The surfaces were rinsed by 7 mL of TE at pH 8.0 and 7 mL of Phosphate Buffered Saline Millipore 524650, referred to after as PBS, with 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.4, and stored at $4^{\circ}$C. 

## {#sec:Cantilevers} Streptravidin-functionalized cantilevers

Functionalized cantilevers with nominal spring constants of 4 $\frac{\text{pN}}{nm}$  were used for all experiments. The protocol below etches away gold to improve force stability @sullan_atomic_2013 and covalently attaches streptatividin to the etched cantilevers to improve attachment to the biotinylated DNA. AFM cantilevers Asylum Research BL-RC-150VB were serially rinsed for 30 seconds in 50 mL of gold etchant Transene TFA, 250 mL of deionized water, 50 mL of chromium etchant Transene 1020, and 250 mL of deionized water. The tips were then serially rinsed for 30 seconds in 50 mL of deionized water, isopropanol, toluene, isopropanol, and deionized water again. After drying, the tips were activated via 30 minutes exposure in a UV-Ozone chamber and incubated for three hours in a 70 mL, $60^{\circ}$C solution of 0.15 mg/mL 600 Dalton Silane-PEG-Maleimide Nanocs PG2-MLSL-600 dissolved in toluene. The maleimide-functionalized tips were serially rinsed in 50 mL of toluene, isopropanol, and water, immediately dried KimTech 5511, and immersed for three hours in a 0.2 mg/mL solution of thiol-streptavidin Protein Mods SAVT in PBS at pH 6.75 with 1 mM TCEP Thermo Scientific 77720 at room temperature in a moisture-proof container. Subsequently, the tips were transferred to $4^{\circ}$C overnight. After the $4^{\circ}$C incubation, to remove free streptavidin, the tips were serially rinsed in two 10 mL beakers of PBS at pH 7.4 and submerged in a 20 mL petri dish of PBS for 10 minutes. These functionalized tips were stored in 50 \textmu{L} of PBS at $4^{\circ}$C in plastic wafers Entegris H22-10/11-0615 until loading into the atomic force microscope. 



# {#sec:DesignDetails}  Algorithm design

This section details the event-detection algorithm. The following conventions are followed:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item All variables with uppercase letters are random variables.
 \item All variables with lowercase letters are either instances of the corresponding uppercase random variables (\textit{i.e.}, measurements) or pure functions.
 \item All variables with a hat (\textit{e.g.}, $\hat{\epsilon}_t$) are estimators of a variable.
\end{enumerate}

##Defining the no-event hypothesis

\FEATHER defines an event as a discontinuity in piecewise-continuous time series data. In \SMFS, events occur when the force applied to a molecule exhibits a discontinuity as the molecule passes over an energy barrier. \FEATHER assumes that events take place on time scales much smaller than the response time of the probe. If this is not true, the data is assumed smoothed until this condition is reached. The algorithm models the data assuming no event is occurring at a given time '$t$' and finds where the probability of a measurement is low. Hereafter, the definition of an event and these assumptions will be referred to as the \emph{no-event hypothesis}. 

##Mathematical background for testing the no-event hypothesis

Under the no-event hypothesis, the noise-dependent distribution of force 'F$_t$' for a discrete series of forces sampled at time points 't' can be well-approximated by the sum of a smooth signal and a noise distribution ({#fig:FeatherExample}):

\eqs{ F_t = g_t + X(0,\sigma^2) }

where $g_t$ is a smooth function with a continuous first derivative and X is a random variable with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$. The closed form of the smooth signal and the noise distribution are assumed unknown and can vary from one \fec{} to the next. If '$g^{*}_t$' is a function with a continuous first derivative approximately equal to $g_t$ such that $\forall t,\epsilon_t\equiv|g^{*}_t-g_t|$ for real $\epsilon_t\ge 0$, then the error distribution $R_t$ is defined such that: 

$$ R_t \equiv F_t - g^{*}_t = \epsilon_t + X(0,\sigma) $$ {#eq:error}

where

$$ E[R_t^2] -E[R_t]^2 = [(g_t-g^{*}_t)^2 + E[X(0,\sigma)^2]] - (g_t-g^{*}_t)^2  = \sigma^2 $$ {#eq:feathersigma}

and 

$$ |E[R_t]| = \epsilon_t \le E[|R_t|] $$ {#eq:featherepsilon}

Under these assumptions, the probability 'P' of measuring $r_t$ is bounded by Chebyshev's inequality:

$$ P( |R_t-\epsilon_t| \ge |r_t-\epsilon_t| ) \le
(\frac{\sigma}{|r_t-\epsilon_t|})^2 $$ {#eq:featherprobability}


For \emph{any} noise distribution, {#eq:featherprobability} bounds the probability of a measurement under the no-event hypothesis, given the force approximation $g^{*}_t$ (which in turn yields the estimator error $\hat{\epsilon}$ and the noise $\hat{\sigma}$ by {#eq:featherepsilon} and {#eq:feathersigma}). A low probability at a given time implies the measurement is unlikely under the no-event hypothesis. 

##Accurate estimators for hypothesis testing

To obtain an accurate estimator for $g_t$, the data must be smoothed. The approximation to the noiseless force $g^{*}_t$ is obtained by fitting a least-squares second-order basis spline @dierckx_algorithm_1975 to the force versus time curve. The spline is second-order to ensure a continuous first derivative ({#fig:FeatherExample}), and the spline knots are spaced uniformly at intervals of  the user-specified $\tau$ (see {#tbl:Parameters}). {#fig:FeatherExample} is a representative demonstration of the spline fitting. Determining  $g^{*}_t$ immediately gives $\hat{r}_t$ by  {#eq:error}.

Using $r_t$ as shown in {#eq:feather-epsilon} does not provide a strong signal in the presence of an event (see {#fig:FeatherExample}). In order to improve the method, $r_t$ was replaced by the distribution of windowed standard deviations '$\Sigma$'. $\Sigma$ is defined as the standard deviation of $r_t$ centered at t with a window of $[-\frac{\tau}{4},\frac{\tau}{4}]$. Using $\Sigma$ instead of $r_t$ provides a much stronger signal in the presence of an event (see {#fig:FeatherExample}).  

The noise variables $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ are estimated from the distribution of standard deviations $\Sigma$ on the region of the approach curve where the AFM tip is not in contact with the surface. From this distribution, $\hat{\sigma}$ is set to the standard deviation of $\Sigma$, and $\hat{\epsilon}_t$ is approximated by the median. The median is used instead of the mean to remove the influence of possible false positive events in the approach. The removal of these pseudo-events is necessary to ensure accurate estimators for $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, which are based on the no-event hypothesis. 

The quality of \FEATHER's results are improved by multiplying the no-event probability, as discussed above, by the integral force, force derivative, and force differential Chebyshev probabilities. This is explicitly detailed in {#fig:Code}. The calculation of each of these probabilities is exactly the same as {#eq:feather-probability}, with the variables changed appropriately. Specifically, the relevant operation (integration, differentiation, or force difference) is applied to the approach, estimates for the operation-specific $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ are obtained, yielding the operation-specific probability.
