	abstract = {Dynamic force spectroscopy probes the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of single molecules and molecular assemblies. Here, we propose a simple procedure to extract kinetic information from such experiments. The cornerstone of our method is a transformation of the rupture-force histograms obtained at different force-loading rates into the force-dependent lifetimes measurable in constant-force experiments. To interpret the force-dependent lifetimes, we derive a generalization of Bell's formula that is formally exact within the framework of Kramers theory. This result complements the analytical expression for the lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model potentials. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing the nanopore unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached by flexible linkers to an atomic force microscope. Our procedure to transform rupture-force histograms into the force-dependent lifetimes remains valid even when the molecular extension is a poor reaction coordinate and higher-dimensional free-energy surfaces must be considered. In this case the microscopic interpretation of the lifetimes becomes more challenging because the lifetimes can reveal richer, and even nonmonotonic, dependence on the force.},

The rupture force of the streptavidin-biotin bond increased more than 2-fold over a range of loading rates between 100 and 5000 pN/s. Moreover, the force measurements showed two regimes of loading in the streptavidin-biotin force spectrum, revealing the presence of two activation barriers in the unbinding process. Parallel experiments carried out with a streptavidin mutant (W120F) were used to investigate the molecular determinants of the activation barriers. From these experiments, we attributed the outer activation barrier in the energy landscape to the molecular interaction of the {\textquoteleft}3-4' loop of streptavidin that closes behind biotin.},

	abstract = {The folding and unfolding kinetics of single molecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, can be explored by mechanical pulling experiments. Determining intrinsic kinetic information, at zero stretching force, usually requires an extrapolation by fitting a theoretical model. Here, we apply a recent theoretical approach describing molecular rupture in the presence of force to unfolding kinetic data obtained from coarse-grained simulations of ubiquitin. Unfolding rates calculated from simulations over a broad range of stretching forces, for different pulling directions, reveal a remarkable {\textquotedblleft}turnover{\textquotedblright} from a force-independent process at low force to a force-dependent process at high force, akin to the {\textquotedblleft}roll-over{\textquotedblright} in unfolding rates sometimes seen in studies using chemical denaturant. While such a turnover in rates is unexpected in one dimension, we demonstrate that it can occur for dynamics in just two dimensions. We relate the turnover to the quality of the pulling direction as a reaction coordinate for the intrinsic folding mechanism. A novel pulling direction, designed to be the most relevant to the intrinsic folding pathway, results in the smallest turnover. Our results are in accord with protein engineering experiments and simulations which indicate that the unfolding mechanism at high force can differ from the intrinsic mechanism. The apparent similarity between extrapolated and intrinsic rates in experiments, unexpected for different unfolding barriers, can be explained if the turnover occurs at low forces.},

The studies of SSB-binding mode transition and cooperativity are therefore critical to many cellular processes like DNA repair and replication. However, only a few atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations of ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments have been conducted so far. The point is that adsorption of ssDN A{\textendash}SSB complexes on mica, necessary for AFM imaging, is not an easy task. Here, we addressed this issue by using spermidine as a binding agent. This trivalent cation induces a stronger adsorption on mica than divalent cations, which are commonly used by AFM users but are ineffective in the adsorption of ssDNA{\textendash}SSB complexes. At low spermidine concentration ({\textless}0.3 mM), we obtained AFM images of ssDNA{\textendash}SSB complexes (E. coli SSB, gp32 and yRPA) on mica at both low and high ionic strengths. In addition, partially or fully saturated nucleoprotein filaments were studied at various monovalent salt concentrations thus allowing the observation of SSB-binding mode transition. In association with conventional biochemical techniques, this work should make it possible to study the dynamics of DNA processes involving DNA{\textendash}SSB complexes as intermediates by AFM.},

Understanding how protein domains and subunits operate is critical for engineering novel functions into proteins. Arslan et al. introduced intramolecular crosslinks between two domains of the Escherichia coli helicase Rep, which unwinds DNA. By inserting linkers of different lengths, the domains can be held either {\textquotedblleft}open{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}closed.{\textquotedblright} The closed conformation activates the helicase, but it can also generate super-helicases capable of unzipping long stretches of DNA at high speed and with considerable force. Comstock et al. used optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy to simultaneously measure the structure and function of the bacterial helicase UvrD. They monitored its DNA winding and unwinding activity and its shape during these activities. The motor domain also has a {\textquotedblleft}closed{\textquotedblright} conformation during DNA unwinding and switches to a reversed {\textquotedblleft}open{\textquotedblright} conformation during the zipping-up interaction.
Science, this issue p. 344 and p. 352
The relationship between protein three-dimensional structure and function is essential for mechanism determination. Unfortunately, most techniques do not provide a direct measurement of this relationship. Structural data are typically limited to static pictures, and function must be inferred. Conversely, functional assays usually provide little information on structural conformation. We developed a single-molecule technique combining optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy that allows for both measurements simultaneously. Here we present measurements of UvrD, a DNA repair helicase, that directly and unambiguously reveal the connection between its structure and function. Our data reveal that UvrD exhibits two distinct types of unwinding activity regulated by its stoichiometry. Furthermore, two UvrD conformational states, termed {\textquotedblleft}closed{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}open,{\textquotedblright} correlate with movement toward or away from the DNA fork.
Both structure and function can be studied at the same time while an enzyme unzips DNA.

	abstract = {A methodology has been developed for the study of molecular recognition at the level of single events and for the localization of sites on biosurfaces, in combining force microscopy with molecular recognition by specific ligands. For this goal, a sensor was designed by covalently linking an antibody (anti-human serum albumin, polyclonal) via a flexible spacer to the tip of a force microscope. This sensor permitted detection of single antibody-antigen recognition events by force signals of unique shape with an unbinding force of 244 +/- 22 pN. Analysis revealed that observed unbinding forces originate from the dissociation of individual Fab fragments from a human serum albumin molecule. The two Fab fragments of the antibody were found to bind independently and with equal probability. The flexible linkage provided the antibody with a 6-nm dynamical reach for binding, rendering binding probability high, 0.5 for encounter times of 60 ms. This permitted fast and reliable detection of antigenic sites during lateral scans with a positional accuracy of 1.5 nm. It is indicated that this methodology has promise for characterizing rate constants and kinetics of molecular recognition complexes and for molecular mapping of biosurfaces such as membranes.},

	abstract = {It has long been accepted that occurrences of a known signal are most effectively detected by cross-correlating the incoming data stream with a waveform template. Such matched signal detectors have received very little attention in the field of detection seismology because there are relatively few instances in which the form of an anticipated seismic signal is known a priori. Repeating events in highly confined geographical regions have been observed to produce very similar waveforms and good signals from events at a given site can be exploited to detect subsequent co-located events at lower magnitudes than would be possible using traditional power detectors. Even greater improvement in signal detectability can be achieved using seismic arrays; running correlation coefficients from single sensors can be stacked over an array or network to result in a network correlation coefficient displaying a significant array gain. If two events are co-located, the time separating the corresponding patterns in the wave train as indicated by the cross-correlation function is identical for all seismic stations and this property means that the correlation coefficient traces are coherent even when the waveforms are not. We illustrate the power of array-based waveform correlation using the 1997 August 16 Kara Sea event. The weak event that occurred 4 hr after the main event was barely detected using an STA/LTA detector on the SPITS array but is readily detected by signal matching on a single channel. The main event was also recorded by the far more distant NORSAR array but no conventional detection can be made for the second event. A clear detection is, however, made when the correlation coefficient traces are beamformed over all sensors of the array. We estimate the reduction in detection threshold of a test signal on a regional seismic array using waveform correlation by scaling down a master signal and immersing it into seismic noise. We show that, for this case, waveform correlation using a single channel detects signals of approximately 0.7 orders of magnitude lower than is possible using an STA/LTA detector on the array beam. Waveform matching on the full array provides an additional improvement of approximately 0.4 magnitude units. We describe a case study in which small seismic events at the Barentsburg coal mine on Spitsbergen were detected using the signals from a major rockburst as master waveforms. Many spurious triggers occurred in this study whereby short sections of signal exhibited coincidental similarity with unrelated incoming wave fronts. We demonstrate how such false alarms can almost always be identified and screened out automatically by performing frequency{\textendash}wavenumber analysis upon the set of individual correlation coefficient traces.},

	abstract = {Events of scientific interest in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including conformational changes, folding transitions, and translocations of ligands and reaction products, often correspond to high-level structural rearrangements that alter contacts between molecules or among different parts of a molecule. Due to advances in computer architecture and software, MD trajectories representing such structure-changing events have become easier to generate, but the length of these trajectories poses a challenge to scientific interpretation and analysis. In this paper, we present automated methods for the detection of potentially important structure-changing events in long MD trajectories. In contrast with traditional tools for the analysis of such trajectories, our methods provide a detailed report of broken and formed contacts that aids in the identification of specific time-dependent side-chain interactions. Our approach employs a coarse-grained representation of amino acid side chains, a contact metric based on higher order generalizations of Delaunay tetrahedralization, techniques for detecting significant shifts in the resulting contact time series, and a new kernel-based measure of contact alteration activity. The analysis methods we describe are incorporated in a newly developed package, called TimeScapes, which is freely available and compatible with trajectories generated by a variety of popular MD programs. Tests based on actual microsecond time scale simulations demonstrate that the package can be used to efficiently detect and characterize important conformational changes in realistic protein systems.},

This paper describes a new use for wavelets{\textemdash}identifying trends in time series. The general signal considered has a quadratic trend. The inverted Haar wavelet and the elephant wavelet, respectively, provide estimates of the first-order and second-order coefficients in the trend polynomial. Unlike usual wavelet applications, however, this analysis requires only one wavelet dilation scale L, where L is the total length of the time series. Error analysis shows that wavelet trend detection is roughly half as accurate as least squares trend detection when accuracy is evaluated in terms of the mean-square error in estimates of the first-order and second-order trend coefficients. But wavelet detection is more than twice as efficient as least squares detection in the sense that it requires fewer than half the number of floating-point operations of least squares regression to yield the three coefficients of the quadratic trend polynomial. This paper demonstrates wavelet trend detection using artificial data and then various turbulence data collected in the atmospheric surface layer, and last, provides guidelines on when linear and quadratic trends are {\textquotedblleft}significant{\textquotedblright} enough to require removal from a time series.},

In this paper an algorithm is presented, which needs no initial subjective assumptions. Monotone trends are approximated by piecewise linear curves obtained by dividing into subintervals the signal values interval, not the time interval. The slope of each linear segment of the estimated trend is proportional to the average one-step displacement of the signal values included into the corresponding subinterval. The evaluation of the trend removal is performed on statistical ensembles of artificial time series with the random component given by realizations of autoregressive of order one stochastic processes or by fractional Brownian motions. The accuracy of the algorithm is compared with that of two well-tested methods: polynomial fitting and a nonparametric method based on moving average. For stationary noise the results of the algorithm are slightly better, but for nonstationary noise the preliminary results indicate that the polynomial fitting has the best accuracy. As a verification on a real time series, the time periods with monotone variation of global average temperature over the last 1800years are established. The removal of a nonmonotone trend is also briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information about how best to adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise constant, piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori unclear whether such performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data alone. We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive method, RiskShrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet coefficients. RiskShrink used in connection with sample rotation. Inclusion probabilities of any order can be written explicitly in closed form. Second-order inclusion probabilities $\pi$ij satisfy the condition \$0 {\textless} {\textbackslash}pi\_\{ij\} {\textless} {\textbackslash}pi\_\{i\}{\textbackslash}pi\_j\$, which guarantees Yates \& Grundy's variance estimator to be unbiased, definable for all samples and always nonnegative for any sample size.},

	abstract = {About 1\% of the people in the world suffer from epilepsy and 30\% of epileptics are not helped by medication. Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities, and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. In this research, discrete Daubechies and harmonic wavelets are investigated for analysis of epileptic EEG records. Wavelet transform is used to analyze and characterize epileptiform discharges in the form of 3-Hz spike and wave complex in patients with absence seizure. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. The capability of this mathematical microscope to analyze different scales of neural rhythms is shown to be a powerful tool for investigating small-scale oscillations of the brain signals. Wavelet analyses of EEGs obtained from a population of patients can potentially suggest the physiological processes undergoing in the brain in epilepsy onset. A better understanding of the dynamics of the human brain through EEG analysis can be obtained through further analysis of such EEG records.},

	abstract = {Biomolecular simulations at millisecond and longer time-scales can provide vital insights into functional mechanisms. Because post-simulation analyses of such large trajectory datasets can be a limiting factor in obtaining biological insights, there is an emerging need to identify key dynamical events and relating these events to the biological function online, that is, as simulations are progressing. Recently, we have introduced a novel computational technique, quasi-anharmonic analysis (QAA) (Ramanathan et al., PLoS One 2011;6:e15827), for partitioning the conformational landscape into a hierarchy of functionally relevant sub-states. The unique capabilities of QAA are enabled by exploiting anharmonicity in the form of fourth-order statistics for characterizing atomic fluctuations. In this article, we extend QAA for analyzing long time-scale simulations online. In particular, we present HOST4MD{\textemdash}a higher-order statistical toolbox for molecular dynamics simulations, which (1) identifies key dynamical events as simulations are in progress, (2) explores potential sub-states, and (3) identifies conformational transitions that enable the protein to access those sub-states. We demonstrate HOST4MD on microsecond timescale simulations of the enzyme adenylate kinase in its apo state. HOST4MD identifies several conformational events in these simulations, revealing how the intrinsic coupling between the three subdomains (LID, CORE, and NMP) changes during the simulations. Further, it also identifies an inherent asymmetry in the opening/closing of the two binding sites. We anticipate that HOST4MD will provide a powerful and extensible framework for detecting biophysically relevant conformational coordinates from long time-scale simulations.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) is the only technique available for obtaining dynamic protein data at atomic spatial resolution and picosecond or finer temporal resolution. In recent years, the cost of computational resources has decreased exponentially while the number of known protein structures, many of which are not characterized biochemically, has increased rapidly. These events have led to an increase in the use of MD in biological research, both to examine phenomena that cannot be resolved experimentally and to generate hypotheses that direct further experimental research. In fact, several databases of MD simulations have arisen in recent years. MD simulations, and especially MD simulation databases, contain massive amounts of data, yet interesting phenomena often occur over very short time periods and on the scale of only a few atoms. Analysis of such data must balance these fine-detail events with the global picture they create. Here, we address the multiscale nature of the problem by comparing several MD analysis methods to show their strengths and weaknesses at various scales using the wild-type and R282W mutant forms of the DNA-binding domain of protein p53. By leveraging these techniques together, we are able to pinpoint fine-detail and big picture differences between the protein{\textquoteright}s variants. Our analyses indicate that the R282W mutation of p53 destabilizes the L1 loop and loosens the H2 helix conformation, but the loosened L1 loop can be rescued by residue H115, preventing the R282W mutation from completely destabilizing the protein or abolishing activity.},

It is therefore well-suited to analyzing long timescale simulations, which are critical for studying biologically relevant motions but may be too large for traditional analysis methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that the patterns discovered by DTA often correspond to functionally important conformational substates. In particular, we apply DTA to a 150 ns simulation of ubiquitin and discover patterns that provide unique insights into ubiquitin's ability to bind multiple substrates. Moreover, we take advantage of DTA's ability to identify patterns on different timescales and investigate how fast positional fluctuations may modulate slower, large-scale motions in functionally important regions. Our findings here suggest that DTA is well-suited to organizing, visualizing, and analyzing very large trajectories and discovering conformational substates.},

We developed a method that accurately identifies changes in such systems by searching concurrently for change times and the subset of measured quantities that change at each of these times. This work was motivated by the challenge of detecting biologically interesting structural changes in proteins, but our method may prove useful in diverse application domains., Research on change-point detection, the classical problem of detecting abrupt changes in sequential data, has focused predominantly on datasets with a single observable. A growing number of time series datasets, however, involve many observables, often with the property that a given change typically affects only a few of the observables. We introduce a general statistical method that, given many noisy observables, detects points in time at which various subsets of the observables exhibit simultaneous changes in data distribution and explicitly identifies those subsets. Our work is motivated by the problem of identifying the nature and timing of biologically interesting conformational changes that occur during atomic-level simulations of biomolecules such as proteins. This problem has proved challenging both because each such conformational change might involve only a small region of the molecule and because these changes are often subtle relative to the ever-present background of faster structural fluctuations. We show that our method is effective in detecting biologically interesting conformational changes in molecular dynamics simulations of both folded and unfolded proteins, even in cases where these changes are difficult to detect using alternative techniques. This method may also facilitate the detection of change points in other types of sequential data involving large numbers of observables{\textemdash}a problem likely to become increasingly important as such data continue to proliferate in a variety of application domains.},

In this regard, the WT permits filtering out the high-frequency noise without completely omitting the high-frequency phenomena whose contribution is crucial in cases where the dynamics is localized in frequency and time. Two time series are studied, resulting respectively from the deterministic dynamics of a three-dimensional polymer chain and the stochastic dynamics of a one-dimensional polymer model subjected to random forces within the Langevin equation formalism. The WT is observed to excel in reconstructing the original signal by a subset of the basis used in the analysis and in identifying the occurrence of rare phenomena by examining the wavelet energies at high-resolution levels.},

Ultrafast folders are an invaluable tool for studying protein behavior as folding and unfolding events measured by experiment occur on timescales accessible with the high-resolution molecular dynamics methods we describe. Finally, to demonstrate the prospect of these methods for folding proteins, a temperature quench simulation of a thermal unfolding intermediate of the Engrailed Homeodomain is described.},

Wavelets are a mathematical tool that first found application in signal processing. The multiresolution analysis of a signal via wavelets provides a hierarchical series of {\textquoteleft}best{\textquoteright} lower-resolution approximations. B-spline ribbons model the protein fold, with one control point per residue. Wavelet analysis sets limits on the information required to define the winding of the backbone through space, suggesting a recognizable fold is generated from a number of points equal to 1/4 or less the number of residues. Wavelets applied to surfaces and volumes show promise in structure-based drug design.},

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm{\"o}ller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Ni{\~n}o3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880{\textendash}1920 and 1960{\textendash}90, and lower power during 1920{\textendash}60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance.

The discovery and implementation of a number of novel methods for extracting useful information from time series has recently revitalized this classical field of study. Considerable progress has also been made in interpreting the information so obtained in terms of dynamical systems theory. In this review we describe the connections between time series analysis and nonlinear dynamics, discuss signal-to-noise enhancement, and present some of the novel methods for spectral analysis. The various steps, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, are illustrated by their application to an important climatic time series, the Southern Oscillation Index. This index captures major features of interannual climate variability and is used extensively in its prediction. Regional and global sea surface temperature data sets are used to illustrate multivariate spectral methods. Open questions and further prospects conclude the review.},

Wavelet analysis remains unknown in the field of hydrology even though it clearly overcomes the well-known limits of the classical Fourier analysis. New wavelet-based tools are proposed to hydrologists in order to make wavelet analysis more attractive. First, a multiresolution continuous wavelet analysis method is shown to significantly improve the determination of the temporal-scale structure of a given signal. Second, the concept of wavelet entropy in both continuous and multiresolution frameworks is introduced allowing for an estimation of the temporal evolution of a given hydrological or climatologic signal's complexity. New insights in the scale-dependence of the relationship are exposed by introducing wavelet cross-correlation and wavelet coherence. Continuous wavelet cross-correlation provides a time{\textendash}scale distribution of the correlation between two signals, whereas continuous wavelet coherence provides a qualitative estimator of the temporal evolution of the degree of linearity of the relationship between two signals on a given scale. These methods are applied to four large river runoffs and two global climatic indexes in a companion paper.},

Using an analogy between WT representation of a time series and a music score, the authors illustrate the importance of local versus global information in the time-frequency localization of climate signals. Examples of WT applied to climate data analysis are demonstrated using analytic signals as well as real climate time series. Results of WT applied to two climate time series{\textemdash}that is, a proxy paleoclimate time series with a 2.5-Myr deep-sea sediment record of $\delta$18O and a 140-yr monthly record of Northern Hemisphere surface temperature{\textemdash}are presented. The former shows the presence of a 40-kyr and a 100-kyr oscillation and an abrupt transition in the oscillation regime at 0.7 Myr before the present, consistent with previous studies. The latter possesses a myriad of oscillatory modes from interannual (2{\textendash}5 yr), interdecadal (10{\textendash}12yr, 20{\textendash}25 yr, and 40{\textendash}60yr), and century (\~{}180 yr) scales at different periods of the data record. In spite of the large difference in timescales, common features in time-frequency characteristics of these two time series have been identified. These features suggest that the variations of the earth's climate are consistent with those exhibited by a nonlinear dynamical system under external forcings.},

	abstract = {Twitter is among the fastest-growing microblogging and online social networking services. Messages posted on Twitter (tweets) have been reporting everything from daily life stories to the latest local and global news and events. Monitoring and analyzing this rich and continuous user-generated content can yield unprecedentedly valuable information, enabling users and organizations to acquire actionable knowledge. This article provides a survey of techniques for event detection from Twitter streams. These techniques aim at finding real-world occurrences that unfold over space and time. In contrast to conventional media, event detection from Twitter streams poses new challenges. Twitter streams contain large amounts of meaningless messages and polluted content, which negatively affect the detection performance. In addition, traditional text mining techniques are not suitable, because of the short length of tweets, the large number of spelling and grammatical errors, and the frequent use of informal and mixed language. Event detection techniques presented in literature address these issues by adapting techniques from various fields to the uniqueness of Twitter. This article classifies these techniques according to the event type, detection task, and detection method and discusses commonly used features. Finally, it highlights the need for public benchmarks to evaluate the performance of different detection approaches and various features.},

	abstract = {The nanometer coordinate measuring machine (NCMM) is developed for comparatively fast large area scans with high resolution. The system combines a metrological atomic force microscope (AFM) with a precise positioning system. The sample is moved under the probe system via the positioning system achieving a scan range of 25 {\texttimes} 25 {\texttimes} 5 mm 3 with a resolution of 0.1 nm. A concept for AFM measurements using a priori knowledge is implemented. The a priori knowledge is generated through measurements with a white light interferometer and the use of CAD data. Dimensional markup language is used as a transfer and target format for a priori knowledge and measurement data. Using the a priori knowledge and template matching algorithms combined with the optical microscope of the NCMM, the region of interest can automatically be identified. In the next step the automatic measurement of the part coordinate system and the measurement elements with the AFM sensor of the NCMM is done. The automatic measurement involves intelligent measurement strategies, which are adapted to specific geometries of the measurement feature to reduce measurement time and drift effects.},

This can either be a direct tip{\textendash}sample interaction or an interaction between molecules coupled to the tip and probe, respectively. The interaction forces are typically in the range of a few pN to some hundred pN. In this article we describe algorithms for the analysis of force{\textendash}distance cycles, to quantify interaction forces between tip and probe. Both, the direct tip{\textendash}probe interaction as well as the interaction between specifically bound molecules are analyzed. The molecules bound to tip and probe have to be either long and flexible or have to be bound via a flexible cross linker. The algorithms are exemplified on direct tip{\textendash}probe interactions and on unbinding events of cadherins which are bound via PEG-spacers to the AFM-tip and to the probe.},

Even if different trade names and different technical implementations are used, for most of these techniques a force{\textendash}distance curve in every image pixel is measured, this curve is immediately fitted by some theoretical dependence and results are displayed as a mechanical properties channel (Young modulus, adhesion, etc).

In this paper, we present a software tool for independent numerical processing of such data, including more numerical models for the force{\textendash}distance curve evaluation and including a simple estimate of uncertainties related to the fitting procedure.

Our results show that elastin changes its mechanical behavior in the presence of electrolytes.

	abstract = {In the first of this two-part discourse on the extraction of elastic properties from atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, a scheme for automating the analysis of force-distance curves was introduced and experimentally validated for the Hertzian (i.e., linearly elastic and noninteractive probe-sample pairs) indentation of soft, inhomogeneous materials. In the presence of probe-sample adhesive interactions, which are common especially during retraction of the rigid tip from soft materials, the Hertzian models are no longer adequate. A number of theories (e.g., Johnson{\textendash}Kendall{\textendash}Roberts and Derjaguin{\textendash}Muller{\textendash}Toporov), covering the full range of sample compliance relative to adhesive force and tip radius, are available for analysis of such data. We incorporated Pietrement and Troyon{\textquoteright}s approximation (2000, {\textquotedblleft}General Equations Describing Elastic Indentation Depth and Normal Contact Stiffness Versus Load~
,{\textquotedblright} J. Colloid Interface Sci., 226(1), pp. 166{\textendash}171) of the Maugis{\textendash}Dugdale model into the automated procedure. The scheme developed for the processing of Hertzian data was extended to allow for adhesive contact by applying the Pietrement{\textendash}Troyon equation. Retraction force-displacement data from the indentation of polyvinyl alcohol gels were processed using the customized software. Many of the retraction curves exhibited strong adhesive interactions that were absent in extension. We compared the values of Young{\textquoteright}s modulus extracted from the retraction data to the values obtained from the extension data and from macroscopic uniaxial compression tests. Application of adhesive contact models and the automated scheme to the retraction curves yielded average values of Young{\textquoteright}s modulus close to those obtained with Hertzian models for the extension curves. The Pietrement{\textendash}Troyon equation provided a good fit to the data as indicated by small values of the mean-square error. The Maugis{\textendash}Dugdale theory is capable of accurately modeling adhesive contact between a rigid spherical indenter and a soft, elastic sample. Pietrement and Troyon{\textquoteright}s empirical equation greatly simplifies the theory and renders it compatible with the general automation strategies that we developed for Hertzian analysis. Our comprehensive algorithm for automated extraction of Young{\textquoteright}s moduli from AFM indentation data has been expanded to recognize the presence of either adhesive or Hertzian behavior and apply the appropriate contact model.},

Since far-field optical profilers are diffraction limited, the means of choice are very often Scanning Probem Microscopes (SPMs), and namely, Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs). Various methods for processing data obtained by AFMs will be discussed. An AFM measurement should deliver the surface micro topography to enable the determination of characteristic values, in particular rms roughness.

	abstract = {Atomic force microscopy operated in the force-spectroscopy mode is now a widespread technique, often used to investigate ligand{\textendash}receptor interactions with the goal of measuring forces at the individual molecule level. However, in an experiment, the simultaneous interaction of several ligand/receptor pairs cannot be excluded. This may produce complicated force curves, although unambiguous ruptures are sometimes observed. In the case of the non-specific adhesion of molecules, such as fibrinogen, to a surface, it is usually difficult to identify the real events on the force curves. This can render the application of fixed rules uneasy and in addition can introduce some degree of arbitrariness if the analysis has to be performed by hand. In the present paper a computer algorithm, aimed at speeding up the processing, and at applying selection rules in a reproducible manner, is proposed. It is applied to force recordings performed at various retraction velocities, thus various loading rates. The influence on the evaluation of the rupture forces of the different parameters that can be set by the operator is discussed.},

The estimated contact points have been compared to those obtained by other published methods, which were applied either for materials with an elastic response to indentation forces or for experiments at high loading rates.

We propose that CP may be algorithmically easier to detect by identifying a linear elastic indentation region of data (high SNR) rather than the contact point itself (low SNR). Utilizing Hertzian mechanics, the data are fitted for the CP. We first detail the algorithm and then evaluate it on sample polymeric and biological materials. As a demonstration of automation, 64 {\texttimes} 64 force maps were analyzed to yield spatially varying topographical and mechanical information of cells. Finally, we compared manually selected CPs to automatically identified CPs and demonstrated that our automated approach is both accurate ({\textless} 10nm difference between manual and automatic) and precise for non-interacting polymeric materials.

	abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) has found wide applicability as a nanoindentation tool to measure local elastic properties of soft materials. An automated approach to the processing of AFM indentation data, namely, the extraction of Young{\textquoteright}s modulus, is essential to realizing the high-throughput potential of the instrument as an elasticity probe for typical soft materials that exhibit inhomogeneity at microscopic scales. This paper focuses on Hertzian analysis techniques, which are applicable to linear elastic indentation. We compiled a series of synergistic strategies into an algorithm that overcomes many of the complications that have previously impeded efforts to automate the fitting of contact mechanics models to indentation data. AFM raster data sets containing up to 1024 individual force-displacement curves and macroscopic compression data were obtained from testing polyvinyl alcohol gels of known composition. Local elastic properties of tissue-engineered cartilage were also measured by the AFM. All AFM data sets were processed using customized software based on the algorithm, and the extracted values of Young{\textquoteright}s modulus were compared to those obtained by macroscopic testing. Accuracy of the technique was verified by the good agreement between values of Young{\textquoteright}s modulus obtained by AFM and by direct compression of the synthetic gels. Validation of robustness was achieved by successfully fitting the vastly different types of force curves generated from the indentation of tissue-engineered cartilage. For AFM indentation data that are amenable to Hertzian analysis, the method presented here minimizes subjectivity in preprocessing and allows for improved consistency and minimized user intervention. Automated, large-scale analysis of indentation data holds tremendous potential in bioengineering applications, such as high-resolution elasticity mapping of natural and artificial tissues.},

This can either be a direct tip{\textendash}sample interaction or an interaction between molecules coupled to the tip and probe, respectively. The interaction forces are typically in the range of a few pN to some hundred pN. In this article we describe algorithms for the analysis of force{\textendash}distance cycles, to quantify interaction forces between tip and probe. Both, the direct tip{\textendash}probe interaction as well as the interaction between specifically bound molecules are analyzed. The molecules bound to tip and probe have to be either long and flexible or have to be bound via a flexible cross linker. The algorithms are exemplified on direct tip{\textendash}probe interactions and on unbinding events of cadherins which are bound via PEG-spacers to the AFM-tip and to the probe.},

It is about 5{\textendash}10 times faster than oscillating mode imaging (in conventional AFM setups), and provides topographs of biological samples with sub-molecular resolution and at a high signal-to-noise ratio. Unfortunately, contact mode imaging is sensitive to the applied force and intrinsic force drift: inappropriate force applied by the AFM tip damages the soft biological samples. We present a methodology that automatically searches for and maintains high resolution imaging forces. We found that the vertical and lateral vibrations of the probe during scanning are valuable signals for the characterization of the actual applied force by the tip. This allows automated adjustment and correction of the setpoint force during an experiment. A system that permanently performs this methodology steered the AFM towards high resolution imaging forces and imaged purple membrane at molecular resolution and live cells at high signal-to-noise ratio for hours without an operator.},

	abstract = {Recently, direct measurements of forces stabilizing single proteins or individual receptor{\textendash}ligand bonds became possible with ultra-sensitive force probe methods like the atomic force microscope (AFM). In force spectroscopy experiments using AFM, a single molecule or receptor{\textendash}ligand pair is tethered between the tip of a micromachined cantilever and a supporting surface. While the molecule is stretched, forces are measured by the deflection of the cantilever and plotted against extension, yielding a force spectrum characteristic for each biomolecular system. In order to obtain statistically relevant results, several hundred to thousand single-molecule experiments have to be performed, each resulting in a unique force spectrum. We developed software and algorithms to analyse large numbers of force spectra. Our algorithms include the fitting polymer extension models to force peaks as well as the automatic alignment of spectra. The aligned spectra allowed recognition of patterns of peaks across different spectra. We demonstrate the capabilities of our software by analysing force spectra that were recorded by unfolding single transmembrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin and NhaA. Different unfolding pathways were detected by classifying peak patterns. Deviant spectra, e.g. those with no attachment or erratic peaks, can be easily identified. The software is based on the programming language C++, the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), the software WaveMetrics IGOR Pro and available open-source at http://bioinformatics.org/fskit/.},

However, the measured total force is a mixture composed of various interactions. While some interactions such as electrostatic or magnetic forces can be excluded by a careful design of the experiment, the subtraction of van der Waals forces, which mainly originate from London dispersion interactions between the macroscopic tip shank and the bulk sample, remains a challenge. We present the determination of the inherently present van der Waals forces in total interaction force data from fitting a suitable model, allowing for extraction of the short-range force component. We compare the applicability of several van der Waals models based on experimental interaction data from the calcite(10{\textasciimacron}14) surface. The feasibility to fit these models to experimental data is critically discussed. We furthermore introduce criteria to assess the transition point from pure long-range interaction to mixed short- and long-range forces based on the variance of lateral and vertical force data. This determination allows us to extract the short-range interaction forces, which remained a challenge so far in NC-AFM experiments.},

Here, we developed a fully automated single-molecule force spectroscope. The instrument is able to perform SMFS while monitoring and regulating experimental conditions such as buffer composition and temperature. Cantilever alignment and calibration can also be automatically performed during experiments. This, combined with in-line data analysis, enables the instrument, once set up, to perform complete SMFS experiments autonomously.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Misfolding of membrane proteins plays an important role in many human diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, hereditary deafness, and diabetes insipidus. Little is known about membrane proteins as there are only a very few high-resolution structures. Single-molecule force spectroscopy is a novel technique which measures the force necessary to pull a protein out of a membrane. Such force curves contain valuable information about the protein's structure, conformation, and inter- and intra-molecular forces. High-throughput force spectroscopy experiments generate hundreds of force curves including spurious and good curves, which correspond to different unfolding pathways and to different functional states of an investigated membrane protein. Results: In the present work we propose a novel application of automated unfolding pattern recognition routines. We apply our method to datasets from unfolding experiments of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and bovine rhodopsin (Rho). As a result, we discuss the different unfolding pathways of bR, and two functional states for Rho could be observed . Overall, the algorithm tackles the force spectroscopy bottleneck and leads to more consistent and reproducible results paving the way for high-throughput analysis of structural features of membrane proteins.},

This capability will become more valuable to biological sciences if AFM additionally acquires an ability of high-speed imaging, because {\textquoteleft}direct and real-time visualization{\textquoteright} is a straightforward and powerful means to understand biomolecular processes. With conventional AFMs, it takes more than a minute to capture an image, while biomolecular processes generally occur on a millisecond timescale or less. In order to fill this large gap, various efforts have been carried out in the past decade. Here, we review these past efforts, describe the current state of the capability and limitations of high-speed AFM, and discuss possibilities that may break the limitations and lead to the development of a truly useful high-speed AFM for biological sciences.

 domains of a prototypical Ig superfamily CAM that contains intradomain
 disulfide bonds. The Ig domains of all such CAMs have conformations
 homologous to cadherin extracellular domains, titin Ig-type domains,
 and fibronectin type-III (FNIII) domains. Atomic force microscopy has
 been used to extend the five Ig domains of Mel-CAM (melanoma CAM){\textemdash}a
 protein that is overexpressed in metastatic melanomas{\textemdash}under conditions
 where the disulfide bonds were either left intact or disrupted through
 reduction. Under physiological conditions where intradomain disulfide
 bonds are intact, partial unfolding was observed at forces far smaller
 than those reported previously for either titin's Ig-type domains or
 tenascin's FNIII domains. This partial unfolding under low force may
 be an important mechanism for imparting elasticity to cell{\textendash}cell
 contacts, as well as a regulatory mechanism for adhesive interactions.
 Under reducing conditions, Mel-CAM's Ig domains were found to fully
 unfold through a partially folded state and at slightly higher forces.
 The results suggest that, in divergent evolution of all such domains,
 stabilization imparted by disulfide bonds relaxes requirements for
 strong, noncovalent, folded-state interactions.},

We implemented an algorithm based on the windowed fast Fourier transform of force{\textendash}extension traces that identifies peaks using force{\textendash}extension regimes to correctly identify usable recordings from proteins composed of repeated domains. This algorithm excels as a real-time diagnostic because it involves \&lt;30 ms computational time, has high sensitivity and specificity, and efficiently detects weak unfolding events.

	abstract = {Single molecule force spectroscopy has evolved into an important and extremely powerful technique for investigating the folding potentials of biomolecules. Mechanical tension is applied to individual molecules, and the subsequent, often stepwise unfolding is recorded in force extension traces. However, because the energy barriers of the folding potentials are often close to the thermal energy, both the extensions and the forces at which these barriers are overcome are subject to marked fluctuations. Therefore, force extension traces are an inadequate representation despite widespread use particularly when large populations of proteins need to be compared and analyzed. We show in this article that contour length, which is independent of fluctuations and alterable experimental parameters, is a more appropriate variable than extension. By transforming force extension traces into contour length space, histograms are obtained that directly represent the energy barriers. In contrast to force extension traces, such barrier position histograms can be averaged to investigate details of the unfolding potential. The cross-superposition of barrier position histograms allows us to detect and visualize the order of unfolding events. We show with this approach that in contrast to the sequential unfolding of bacteriorhodopsin, two main steps in the unfolding of the enzyme titin kinase are independent of each other. The potential of this new method for accurate and automated analysis of force spectroscopy data and for novel automated screening techniques is shown with bacteriorhodopsin and with protein constructs containing GFP and titin kinase.},

Among wavelet-based denoising approaches, the Bayesian techniques give more accurate estimates. Considering interscale dependencies, these estimates become closer to the original image. In this context, the choice of an appropriate model for wavelet coefficients is an important issue. The performance can also be improved by estimating model parameters in a local neighborhood. In this paper, we propose the bivariate normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution, which can model a wide range of heavy-tailed to less heavy-tailed processes, to model the local wavelet coefficients at adjacent scales. We will show that this new statistical model is superior to the conventional generalized Gaussian (GG) model. Then, a minimum mean square error-based (MMSE-based) Bayesian estimator is designed to effectively remove noise from wavelet coefficients. Exploiting this new statistical model in the dual-tree complex wavelet domain, we achieved state-of-the-art performance among related recent denoising approaches, both visually and in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).},

	abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used in the biological sciences. Despite 25 years of technical developments, two popular modes of bioAFM, imaging and single molecule force spectroscopy, remain hindered by relatively poor force precision and stability. Recently, we achieved both sub-pN force precision and stability under biologically useful conditions (in liquid at room temperature). Importantly, this sub-pN level of performance is routinely accessible using a commercial cantilever on a commercial instrument. The two critical results are that (i) force precision and stability were limited by the gold coating on the cantilevers, and (ii) smaller yet stiffer cantilevers did not lead to better force precision on time scales longer than 25 ms. These new findings complement our previous work that addressed tip-sample stability. In this review, we detail the methods needed to achieve this sub-pN force stability and demonstrate improvements in force spectroscopy and imaging when using uncoated cantilevers. With this improved cantilever performance, the widespread use of nonspecific biomolecular attachments becomes a limiting factor in high-precision studies. Thus, we conclude by briefly reviewing site-specific covalent-immobilization protocols for linking a biomolecule to the substrate and to the AFM tip.},

Expectation-maximization clustering and the Bayesian information criterion is then used for accurate determination of the true number of states accessible to the system. This procedure allows rigorous and quantitative determination of intensity change points without the artificial time resolution limitations that arise from binning and thresholding.},

Here the use of AFM to directly monitor the folding of an $\alpha$/$\beta$ protein, NuG2, by using low-drift AFM cantilevers is demonstrated. At slow pulling speeds ({\textless}50 nm s-1), the refolding of NuG2 can be clearly observed. Lowering the pulling speed reduces the difference between the unfolding and refolding forces, bringing the non-equilibrium unfolding{\textendash}refolding reactions towards equilibrium. At very low pulling speeds (ca. 2 nm s-1), unfolding and refolding were observed to occur in near equilibrium. Based on the Crooks fluctuation theorem, we then measured the equilibrium free energy change between folded and unfolded states of NuG2. The improved long-term stability of AFM achieved using gold-free cantilevers allows folding{\textendash}unfolding reactions of $\alpha$/$\beta$ proteins to be directly monitored near equilibrium, opening the avenue towards probing the folding reactions of other mechanically important $\alpha$/$\beta$ and all-$\beta$ elastomeric proteins.},

Elucidating the details of how complex proteins fold is a longstanding challenge. Key insights into the unfolding pathways of diverse proteins have come from single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments in which proteins are literally pulled apart. Yu et al. developed a SMFS technique that could unfold individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules in a native lipid bilayer with 1-{\textmu}s temporal resolution (see the Perspective by M{\"u}ller and Gaub). The technique delivered a 100-fold improvement over earlier studies of bacteriorhodopsin and revealed many intermediates not seen before. The authors also observed unfolding and refolding transitions between intermediate states.
Science, this issue p. 945; see also p. 907
Protein folding occurs as a set of transitions between structural states within an energy landscape. An oversimplified view of the folding process emerges when transiently populated states are undetected because of limited instrumental resolution. Using force spectroscopy optimized for 1-microsecond resolution, we reexamined the unfolding of individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules in native lipid bilayers. The experimental data reveal the unfolding pathway in unprecedented detail. Numerous newly detected intermediates{\textemdash}many separated by as few as two or three amino acids{\textemdash}exhibited complex dynamics, including frequent refolding and state occupancies of {\textless}10 $\mu$s. Equilibrium measurements between such states enabled the folding free-energy landscape to be deduced. These results sharpen the picture of the mechanical unfolding of membrane proteins and, more broadly, enable experimental access to previously obscured protein dynamics.

Localised outliers can then be removed one by one, with the possibility of dynamic verification of spectral properties.

Therefore, their detection and correction should be taken seriously when modeling financial data. The present paper focuses on these issues and proposes a general detection and correction method based on wavelets that can be applied to a large class of volatility models. The effectiveness of the new proposal is tested by an intensive Monte Carlo study for six well-known volatility models and compared to alternative proposals in the literature, before it is applied to three daily stock market indices. The Monte Carlo experiments show that the new method is both very effective in detecting isolated outliers and outlier patches and much more reliable than other alternatives, since it detects a significantly smaller number of false outliers. Correcting the data of outliers reduces the skewness and the excess kurtosis of the return series distributions and allows for more accurate return prediction intervals compared to those obtained when the existence of outliers is ignored.},
