\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

\firstp In Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy (\singlemol{}) experiments, mechanical forces are applied to individual biomolecules via a probe such as an optical trap or an atomic force microscope (AFM). Experiments which mechanically pull a molecule apart are known as unfolding experiments. In unfolding experiments, the molecule of interest is pulled apart and force is measured as a function of probe position relative to a relaxed state. Although unfolding experiments are capable of measuring a wide class of molecular phenomena, interpreting \singlemol{} data is hindered by identifying where unfolding events occur in the presence of noise. This paper introduces a new algorithm, \name{} (\acronym), for identifying the locations of molecular unfolding events. \name{} features an relative event location error of 0.005, a 100-fold improvement relative to the best baseline, and a \bc{} coefficient complement of 0.04, a factor of eight improvement relative to the best baseline, for the joint distribution of event loading rates and rupture forces. As a linear-time algorithm for reproducible event identification, \name{} improves the quality of analysis of \singlemol{} data.}
