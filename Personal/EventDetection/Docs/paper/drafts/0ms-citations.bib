	abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) is unique in its capability to capture high-resolution images of biological samples in liquids. This capability will become more valuable to biological sciences if AFM additionally acquires an ability of high-speed imaging, because ‘direct and real-time visualization’ is a straightforward and powerful means to understand biomolecular processes. With conventional AFMs, it takes more than a minute to capture an image, while biomolecular processes generally occur on a millisecond timescale or less. In order to fill this large gap, various efforts have been carried out in the past decade. Here, we review these past efforts, describe the current state of the capability and limitations of high-speed AFM, and discuss possibilities that may break the limitations and lead to the development of a truly useful high-speed AFM for biological sciences.

	abstract = {Directly observing protein folding in real time using atomic force microscopy (AFM) is challenging. Here the use of AFM to directly monitor the folding of an α/β protein, NuG2, by using low-drift AFM cantilevers is demonstrated. At slow pulling speeds ({\textless}50 nm s−1), the refolding of NuG2 can be clearly observed. Lowering the pulling speed reduces the difference between the unfolding and refolding forces, bringing the non-equilibrium unfolding–refolding reactions towards equilibrium. At very low pulling speeds (ca. 2 nm s−1), unfolding and refolding were observed to occur in near equilibrium. Based on the Crooks fluctuation theorem, we then measured the equilibrium free energy change between folded and unfolded states of NuG2. The improved long-term stability of AFM achieved using gold-free cantilevers allows folding–unfolding reactions of α/β proteins to be directly monitored near equilibrium, opening the avenue towards probing the folding reactions of other mechanically important α/β and all-β elastomeric proteins.},
