Abstract

\begin{abstract}

\firstp Non-destructive methods for identifying elemental makeup provide valuable insight for researchers investigating object composition. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) has emerged as an \emph{in situ} method to obtain the elemental makeup of objects, including sub-surface composition. For example, XRF can reconstruct “hidden” paintings beneath a surface image, resolve disputed claims of authorship, and recover text from partially effaced religious documents. XRF traditionally uses synchrotron radiation as a light source and raster scans the artifact of interest. The pixels from the scan are combined into a coherent picture after days of imaging. Recent work focuses on creating two-dimensional images of the artifact's sub-surface elemental composition in hours or days by digitizing photon counts onto a charged coupled device camera. The number of photons in each energy bin for each pixel, constituting the scattered and fluorescent light from the object, are converted into element concentrations by comparing the photon intensities with a prior calibration and correcting for instrumental artifacts and background. This work describes the physical theory, optical instrumentation, and data analysis underpinning recent advances in spatial and temporal resolution in sub-surface reconstruction using XRF.

\section{\sLabel{Intro}Introduction}

\firstp Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool for studying the mechanical properties of biological molecules.  AFM can resolve sub-nanometer molecular structure such as the major and minor grooves of DNA \citePRH{ido_beyond_2013}, lattice structure of membrane-bound proteins \citePRH{muller_surface_1999}, and real-time motion of motor proteins\citePRH{ando_high-speed_2007}. As a force spectroscopy technique, AFM is capable of dynamic experiments including measuring the unfolding and refolding of single proteins\citePRH{he_direct_2015}, unzipping double-stranded DNA\citePRH{krautbauer_Unzipping_2003}, and XXX. The viability of AFM in a wide range of temperatures, solvents, and other environmental variables makes it attractive for studies of biological systems. \pl

During an AFM experiment, an atomically sharp tip attached to a cantilever interacts with a sample(\fRef{Cartoon}). The interaction is measured by the displacement of the tip via deflection of the cantilever. A calibrated tip can record interaction forces from piconewtons to nanonewtons. \pl

In single molecular force spectroscopy (\singlemol{}) experiments, the AFM tip interacts with a molecule and stretches it to measure the relationship between force and extension over time. This experiment records the force-extension curve of the molecule (\fRef{Cartoon}). Force-extension curves yield information such as kinetic rates of processive enzymes \citePRH{comstock_direct_2015}, protein-ligand bond strength \citePRH{yuan_energy_2000}, and the energy landscapes of proteins and nucleic acids \citePRH{dudko_Theory_2008}. \pl

[b] A log-scaled intensity image of the obscured painting's zinc content. \pEndF }
\end{figure}


The analysis and interpretability of \singlemol{} experiments is limited by the attachment of the tip to the molecule of interest. Even with a high-concentration sample, attachment rates between commercially-available AFM tips and most molecules are much less than 0.1\% (XXX cite, see Figure XXX, good example bad example). Attachment rates are improved by coating the AFM tip with a molecule exhibiting high binding affinity for the sample of interest (cite XXX), but the majority of the data taken is still uninterpretable and must be filtered out. Filtering data without events is a major challenge in AFM data management and analysis.\pl

Methods have been proposed to automate manually sorting \singlemol{} data and detect tip-sample events. Automation removes the burden of tedious data filtering and improves scientific reproducibility. Methods include alignment and binning in contour-length space\cite{kuhn_automated_2005,bosshart_reference-free_2012}, thresholding based on signal and noise characteristics \cite{gergely_semi-automatized_2001,roduit_openfovea:_2012} or wavelet transformations \cite{garcia-masso_automated_2016,benitez_searching_2017}, and classification schemes \cite{kasas_fuzzy_2000}. These methods do provide an increased degree of autonomy, but their use is limited by their lack of generalization and interpretability. In particular, contour-length alignment algoriths bias results towards the dominant features and necessarily recquire a polymer model for the contour length as a function of force and extension. In applications interested in novel biomolecules or the short-lived or rare behavior of a biomolecule, alignment algorithms will have limited use.  On the other hand, thresholding and classification-based algorithms generally recquire optimizing many hard-to-interpret parameters. As we show below, these optimizations do not generalize well to the typical range of \singlemol{} data (XXX).\pl

This paper describes a new method based on machine learning for detecting events in \singlemol{} force-extension curves.  The algorithm recquires no \emph{a priori} knowledge of the polymer under study, does not bias interpretation of the data towards the dominant behavior of the data, and has a single, easy-to-interpret parameter which generalizes well to typical \singlemol{} data ranges.  In the first part of the paper, we describe the sample preparation, data acquistition, and data annotation needed to capture the unbinding of functionalized double-stranded DNA from functionalized AFM cantilevers (\fRef{Cartoon}). We then discuss manually annotating the unbinding events in the force-extension curves of the DNA at multiple loading rates, effective contour lengths, and events per curve (XXX cite available online? cite table giving data information?). Finally, we discuss the algorithm for automatically identifying events in force-extension curves and highlight its improved performance (XXX timing?) to previously proposed methods. \pl

\subsection{Sample Preparation}

Site-specific chemistry is used to improve the acquisition rate and quality of data. The procedure for surface, sample, and cantilever preparaton has been described elsewhere (CITE XXX Rob) and in \sRef{SampleDetails}. Briefly, through polymerase chain reaction, double-stranded DNA is functionalized with DBCO at one end to ensure a covalent bond with an azide-functionalized surface. The polymer isalso functionalized with biotin at the opposite end to ensure a specific but reversible bond with a streptavidin-coated cantilever. These two bonds ensure the tip-polymer bond is broken before the surface-polymer bond, preventing tip contamination.

\subsection{\sLabel{Surface}Atomic force microscopy}

All atomic force microscopy measurements were carried out using an Asylum Cypher \supply{Asylum Research}{Cypher ES}. The spring constant and sensitivity were determined using the equipartition theorem method (cite XXX). All measurements were carried out with a 2s pause at the surface (see XXX) at the loading rates noted in the text. To avoid possible non-uniform distributions of the sample in spaces, measurements were taken at points 1$\muup$m separated over a 30$\muup$m x 30$\muup$m grid. 

\subsection{\sLabel{Annotation}Data annotation}

Two hundred force-extension curves with events were obtained at three different loading rates (100nm/s,500nm/s,1000nm/s). The start and end of each event in a curve, as indices offset from the start of the curve, were obtained through manual annotation. The curves and the events were saved into comma-separated value files and are avaiable (XXX). XXX table on data infomation

\subsubsection{\sLabel{Metrics}Performance Metrics}

XXXNumer metrics were used for comparing the event-finding performance of the algorithm with the human-annotated data. For clarity, we define the following, where `k' is one of the K total force-extension curves and `i' and `j` represent either true (t) or predicted (p):

\eqs{ 
x_k &\equiv \text{the total displacement of the force extension curve} \\
d_{i\rightarrow j,k} &\equiv \text{ distribution of distances in `k' from `i' ruptures to the closest `j' ruptures in or $x_k$ if none } \\
F_{1,k} &\equiv 
1-\frac{2}{x_k} \times \frac{d_{t\rightarrow p,k} d_{p\rightarrow t,k}}{d_{t\rightarrow p,k}+d_{p\rightarrow t,k}}  \\ 
\nu_i &\equiv \text{ distribution of `i' loading rates over all k} \\
F_i &\equiv \text{ distribution of `i' rupture forces over all k} \\
d_{(\nu,F),i} &\equiv \text{ joint probability distribution of $\nu_i$ and $F_i$ over all k} \\
 }

For example, $d_{t\rightarrow p,4}$ represents the distances from the true to the predicted events in force-extension curve 4, $\nu_t$ represents the distribution of true ruptures forces over all curves, and $d_{(\nu,F),p}$ represents the 2-d distribution of predicted points in the space of loading rates and rupture forces. Note that $F_{1,k}$ is the distance analogue to an $F_1$ score (XXX cite). The metrics we report, $F_{1,d}$ and $BC_{\nu,F}$ are defined in \tRef{metrics} and respectively give normalized estimates for how closely the distributions of predicted event locations and event properties align with the human-tagged data.

\section{\sLabel{Discussion}Discussion}


\firstp Since the discovery of x-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Conrad R{\"o}ntgen, researchers leveraging x-rays have dramatically improved our understanding of the world, receiving multiple Nobel prizes along the way.\cite{santra_concepts_2009} Fundamental scientific discoveries in early x-ray studies include: illuminating crystal structure by Bragg's x-ray diffraction experiments in 1913,\cite{bragg_reflection_1913} revealing electron orbital state through inelastic x-ray scattering by Compton in 1923,\cite{compton_spectrum_1923} and Klein's generalizations of Compton scattering to higher-energy photons using quantum electrodynamics in 1928.\cite{klein_scattering_1928} In addition to serving as a probe for fundamental investigations of matter, x-rays also find applications in quantifying and identifying industrial pollutants;\cite{luo_determination_2012} imaging oncological and vascular tissues;\cite{butler_bio-medical_2008} and recovering, restoring, or establishing the provenance of works of artistic \cite{janssens_photon-based_2010} or historical \cite{bergmann_archimedes_2007} importance. All these applications are made possible by determining the elemental makeup of the object of interest. \pl

\subsubsection{\sLabel{Beer}XRF depends on wavelength and element}

\firstp XRF is characterized by absorption of a photon by an electron bound to an atom, followed by `relaxation' of the excited atom by emission of an x-ray photon.\cite{jitschin_progress_1990} Relaxation occurs by XRF when the excited electron is ejected and a higher-shell electron `decays' to fill the vacancy, emitting radiation as a result of the decay (\fRef{Basics}). The relaxation process can consist of a complicated series of excitations and decays,\cite{santra_concepts_2009} but the highest-energy and most-radiative initial excitation and decay is the primary focus of XRF experiments and this paper. Photon absorption and electron ejection happen at well-defined incident photon energies, called the \emph{edge energies}, which are a function of the atomic number of the absorbing atom and the ejected electron's shell.\cite{ueda_high-resolution_2003,de_groot_high-resolution_2001} \fRef{Basics} shows the edge energies and naming conventions associated with the highest-energy and most-dominant\cite{chantler_detailed_2000} absorption levels for the first 90 elements. The tightest-bound, 1s$_{\frac{1}{2}}$ electrons, known as the K-shell electrons, are the dominant contributors to XRF by absorption of the incident photons.\cite{chantler_detailed_2000}

\subsubsection{\sLabel{Surface}Azide-functionalied surfaces}

\firstp Glass surfaces were smoothed using 3M Potassium Hydroxide etching as follows. 12mm diameter glass disks \supply{Ted Pella}{26023} were sonicated \supply{Branson}{2510} for 5 minutes in 250mL of 95\% ethanol \supply{Decon}{2801}, sonicated  for 5 minutes in 250mL of ACS grade acetone \supply{Fisher}{A18-4}, and transferred to a 3M solution of Potassium Hydroxide \supply{Fisher}{P250-500} dissolved in 95\% ethanol for 3 minutes. To removed residual KOH, the glass was serially diluted in two 1L beakers of 18.2M$\Omega$ deionized water \supply{Barnstead}{GenPure Pro}. The etched surfaces were dried with 99.8\% pure Nitrogen gas \supply{Airgas}{NI UHP-300} and stored at room temperature. \pl

To create azide-functionalized surfaces, etched glass was activated using 30 minutes exposure in a UV-ozone chamber \supply{Novascan}{PSDP Digital UV Ozone System} and incubated for three hours in a 70mL, 60\degreeC{} solution of 0.15mg/mL 600Dalton Silane-PEG-Azide \supply{Nanocs}{PG2-AZSL-600} dissolved in toluene \supply{Sigma}{179418-4L}. The surfaces were then rinsed serially in 250mL of toluene, isopropanol \supply{Fisher}{A416-4}, and deionized water. The azide-functionalized surfaces were dried with Nitrogen gas and stored in a dust-proof container at 4\degreeC{}. \pl

\firstp For the 1914bp double-stranded DNA, the 1607 forward-sense and 3520 reverse-sense primers (\tRef{Sequences}) for the M13mp18 plasmid \supply{New England BioLabs}{N4018S} were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies  and used for polymerase-chain reaction \supply{Millipore}{71086-4} using 40 cycles on a thermocycler \supply{Bio-Rad}{T100}. The reverse-sense primer was modified to include four biotinylated thyimine bases, and the forward-sense primer was modified to include a 5-prime DBCO after a PEG-spacer. After the desired PCR product was purified \supply{Qiagen}{28106} and the appropriate band selected by 2\% gel electrophoresis \supply{Sigma}{A9539-500}, the agarose was eluted out \supply{Bio-Rad}{732-6165}, the DNA solution was concentrated \supply{Millipore}{UFC501096}, purified \supply{Qiagen}{28106}, and stored at 4\degreeC{} in a solution of TE, 10mM Tris \supply{Fisher}{BP151-1} and 1mM EDTA \supply{Fisher}{S311-500} at pH 8.0. The typical recovery efficiency of this procedure was 25\%. \pl 

For DNA deposition, 20uL of the desired concentration of DNA (see section XXX) was mixed with 80uL of TE at pH 8.0 and deposited onto azide-functionalized glass (see section XXX) affixed with epoxy \supply{Devcon}{14250} to specimen disks \supply{Ted Pella}{16218} and incubated at 4C for 15 hours. The surfaces were rinsed by 7mL of TE pH 8.0 and 7mL of PBS with 1mM EDTA at pH 7.4, and stored at 4\degreeC{}. 

\subsubsection{\sLabel{Cantilevers}Streptravidin-functionalized cantilevers}

\firstp Functionalized cantilevers with nominal spring constants of 4 $\frac{\text{pN}}{nm}$  were used for all experiments. Functionalization etches away gold to improve force stability (XXX cite) and covalently attaches streptatividin to the etched cantilevers to improve attachment to the biotinylated DNA. Commercially available cantilevers \supply{Asylum Research}{BL-RC-150VB} were serially rinsed for 30 seconds in 50mL of gold etchant \supply{Transene}{TFA}, 250mL of deionized water, 50mL of chromium etchant \supply{Transene}{1020}, 250mL of deionized water, and one final rinse in 250mL of deionized water. After drying (XXX -- solvent rinses?), the tips were activated using 30 minutes exposure in a UV-Ozone chamber and incubated for three hours in a 70mL, 60\degreeC{} solution of 0.15mg/mL 600Dalton Silane-PEG-Maleimide \supply{Nanocs}{PG2-MLSL-600} dissolved in toluene. The maleimide-functionalized tips were serially rinsed in 50mL of toluene, isopropanol, water, immediately dried \supply{KimTech}{5511}, and immersed for three hours in a 0.4mg/mL solution of thiol-streptavidin \supply{Protein Mods}{SAVT} in PBS \supply{Millipore}{524650} at pH 6.75 with 1mM TCEP \supply{Thermo Scientific}{77720} at room temperature in a moisture-proof container. The tips were then tranferred to 4\degreeC{} for 15 hours. After the 4\degreeC{} incubation, to remove free streptavidin, the tips were serially rinsed in two 10mL beakers of PBS at pH 7.4 and submerged in a 20mL petri dish of PBS for 10 minutes. The tips were then stored in 50$\muup$L of PBS at 4C in plastic wafers \supply{Entegris}{H22-10/1-0615} until loading into the atomic force microscope. \pl


\subsection{Algorithm Design}

This section detailis the mathematics and choices behind the event-detection algorithm. The following conventions are followed:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item All variables with uppercase letters are random variables.
 \item All variables with lowercase letters are either instances of the corresponding upppercase random variables (i.e., measurements) or pure functions. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Defining the no-event hypothesis}

\firstp During an event, a force-extension curve exhibits a discontinuity in its first derivative in the absence of noise (XXX figure). The algorithm models the data assuming no event is occuring at a given time 't' and finds where the probability of a measurent is low. Hereafter, the assumption of no event at a given time will be called \emph{no-event hypothesis}. 

\subsubsection{Mathematical background for testing the no-event hypothesis}

\firstp Under the no-event hypothesis, the noise-dependent distribution of force `F' for a discrete series of forces sampled at points t is given (XXX Figure) by the following:

\eqs{ F_t = g_t + X(0,\sigma^2) }

where `g$_t$' is the function representing the noiseless force with a continuous first derivative and `X' is a random variable with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$. The closed form of the noiseless force and the noise distribution are unknown and can vary from one force extension curve to the next. If `$g^{*}_t$' is a function with a continuous first derivative approximately equal to $g_t$ such that $\forall t,\epsilon_t\equiv|g^{*}_t-g_t|$ for real $\epsilon_t\ge 0$, then we define an error distribution $R_t$ such that: \pl

\eqs{ R_t \equiv F_t - g^{*}_t }

where

\eqs{ E[R_t^2] -E[R_t]^2 = [(g_t-g^{*}_t)^2 + E[X(0,\sigma)^2]] - (g_t-g^{*}_t)^2  = \sigma^2 }

and 

\eqs{ |E[R_t]| = \epsilon_t \le E[|R_t|] }

In practice (see XXX), we approximate $\epsilon_t$ by the averaging over all time points $\epsilon_t \approx \langle \epsilon_t \rangle_{\text{all t}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N |E[R_t]|$. Under this assumption, the probability `P' of measuring $r_t$ is bounded by Chebyshev's inequality is:

\eqs{ P( |R_t-\epsilon_t| \ge r_t-\epsilon_t ) \le
 (\frac{\sigma}{r_t-\epsilon_t})^2 }


For \emph{any} noise distribution, this bounds the probability of a measurement under the no-event hypothesis, given the force approximation $g^{*}_t$ (which in turn yields the estimator error $\epsilon$ and the noise $\sigma$ by XXX). A low probability at a given time implies the measurement is unlikely under the no-event hypothesis. \pl

\subsubsection{Accurate estimators for hypothesis testing}

XXX autocorrelation time motivation \pl 

The approximation to the noiseless force $g^{*}_t$ is obtained by fitting a least-squares second-order basis spline (b-spline, XXX) to the force versus time curve. The spline is second-order to ensure a continuous first derivative (see XXX), and the spline knots are spaced uniformly at intervals of $\tau$. Figure XXX is a representative demonstration of the spline fitting. Determining  $g^{*}_t$ immediately gives $r_t$ by eq XX.  \pl

Using $r_t$ as shown in eq XXX does not provide a strong signal in the presence of an event(see supplemental Figure XXX). In order to improve the method, the distribution of windowed standard deviations `$s_t$' of $r_t$ centered at t with a window of $[-\frac{\tau}{2},\frac{\tau}{2}]$ was used in place of $r_t$. Using $s_t$ instead of $r_t$ provides a much stronger signal (see Figure XXX).  \pl

The noise variables $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ are estimated from the distribution of standard deviations $s_t$. From this distribution, $\sigma$ is set to the standard deviation of $s_t$ within the interquartile range and $\epsilon$ is approximated by the median. The standard deviation of the interquartile range and median are used instead of the standard deviation of the entire range and mean in order to remove the influence of possible events. The removal of possible events is necessary to ensure accurate estimations of $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, which are based on the no-event hypothesis.
